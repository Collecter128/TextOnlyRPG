# TextOnlyRPG
A text only RPG game
People are free to mod it, and you can share it with other people, but please give me credit if you make something with it.

Features: Being my first game it's really not that fancy or special compaired to other games.
-Text only: No sounds in game, no pictures in game, just text.
-Move between areas to examine them. 
-Fight monsters
-craft things at stores

Please note that as of writing this, the RPG is still being worked on. So it's in a very incomplete state.
